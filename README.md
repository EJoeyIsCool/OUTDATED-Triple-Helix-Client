# Triple-Helix-Client
My more intuitive and customizable client. If you run into any errors, try it on a Google Drive (JS Execution enabled on that site) because the site you are on may simply have JS disabled.

MY INVOLVEMENT: I used AI to generate this, so do be aware that none of this was coded by me. (Also, all the bookmarklets were either made by AI or found online.)

LINKS: I used these custom GPTs:
https://chat.openai.com/g/g-7YTZoVezM-bookmarklet-wizard (For making bookmarklets.)
https://chat.openai.com/g/g-vewp26iCq-bookmarklet-tweaker (For tweaking existing bookmarklets.)
https://chat.openai.com/g/g-PQpUiQtip-bookmarklet-fixer (For replacing unnecessary % characters that browsers substitute certain characters with automatically.)

CUSTOMIZABLE: My intention with this client is to publish something that even people with no coding knowledge can easily access and customize, and to spread more diversity in the sadly small number of clients out there. I made this to be a collection of bookmarklets, so it will work for any number you may want to add. (The Example Client folder should help get you started.)

RESPONSIBILITY: I accept no responsibility for any consequences that might be given to people for using this inappropriately. I am releasing this solely for educational purposes. Don't get yourself into trouble.
