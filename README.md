# Triple-Helix-Client
My more intuitive and customizable client.

Important: I used AI to generate this, so do be aware that none of this is done by me. (Also all of the bookmarklets were either made by AI or found online) My intention with this client is to publish something that even people with no coding knowledge can easily access and customize, and to spread more diversity in the sadly small number of clients out there. I made this to be a collection of bookmarklets, so it will work for any number you may want to add. Take a look at the code, copy and paste it into notepad, make your changes, then minify it if you have any coding knowledge.

PLEASE NOTE: I accept no responsibility for any consequences that might be given to people for using this inappropriately. I am releasing this solely for educational purposes. Don't get yourself into trouble.
