# Triple-Helix-Client
My intuitive and customizable client. If you run into any errors, the site you are on may simply have Javascript execution disabled. If you just want to drag this into your bookmark bar for use, go to the TripleHelixClient.js section. If you want to explore more, check out the other sections.

MY INVOLVEMENT: I used AI to generate this, so do be aware that none of this was coded by me. Also, all the bookmarklets were either made by AI or found online. I would like to give credit to everyone who posted these bookmarklets on GitHub. I am simply compiling them all.

LINKS: I used these custom GPTs:
https://chat.openai.com/g/g-7YTZoVezM-bookmarklet-wizard (For making bookmarklets.)
https://chat.openai.com/g/g-vewp26iCq-bookmarklet-tweaker (For tweaking existing bookmarklets.)
https://ejoeyiscool.github.io/Bookmarklet-Converter (For replacing unnecessary % characters that browsers substitute certain characters with automatically.)

CUSTOMIZABLE: My intention with this client is to publish something that even people with no coding knowledge can easily access and customize, and to spread more diversity in the sadly small number of clients out there. I made this to be a collection of any number of bookmarklets, so it will work for any number you may want to add. (The Example Client folder should help get you started.)

RESPONSIBILITY: I accept no responsibility for any consequences that might be given to people for using this inappropriately. I am releasing this solely for educational purposes. Don't get yourself into trouble.
